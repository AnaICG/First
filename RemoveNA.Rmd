 How to remove NA from a vector 
 Fist, you ask whether there is or not NA 
 Then, you turn it around with !bad
 
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 5, NA, 8)
x
bad <- is.na(x)
bad
x[!bad]
```
 
 complete.cases
 If gives you back a logical vector saying whether you have an NA or not
 
```{r}
v <- c(1, 2, NA, 5, NA, 8)
v
d <- complete.cases(v)
d
```
 
```{r}
v[d]
```
