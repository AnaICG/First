Dates and times

Sys.time() gives you exactly the date and time. Then, you can save it in as.POSIXlt to be appear as a list
```{r}
x <- Sys.time()
x
p <- as.POSIXlt(x)
unclass(p)
p$year
```

```{r}
x <- Sys.time()
x
p <- as.POSIXct(x)
unclass(p)
```
All this long list of numbers is the number of seconds from 1st January 1970

How to move from character to integer in time/dates
```{r}
datestring <- c("January 10, 2012 10:40")
x <- strptime(datestring, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")
x
```
